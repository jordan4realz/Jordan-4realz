<p>Hi! My name is Jordan Bondo but I go by Jordan 4realz. Why "4realz"? Well because someoen took "Jordan4reals" on the internet already, even tho my Snapchat is #Jordan4reals by the way add me ;). I live in Maryland, in the Montgomery county area, I go to MCPS for school. I can't tell you anymore than this for my own safety. I was born in Central Africa Republic it's not known by lot of people. I came in the U.S.A in January 13, 2011 and while growing up I watched Hannah Montannah amd always wanted to be in a Dysney production. But since there's a lot of competition in the Acting industries I decided to share my african values on YouTube. And here I am, trying my best to make you laugh. I also love to do photography check out my Gallery to see awesome images.</p>
